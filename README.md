## Introduction

Welcome to the COVID-19 Data Analysis Project! In this repository, you'll find a comprehensive Python project designed to analyze and visualize COVID-19 data using a provided CSV file. The project aims to empower users to gain insights into the spread and impact of the pandemic.

## Features

1.Data Source:
The project utilizes a curated COVID-19 dataset in CSV format, ensuring reliability and consistency in the information.

2.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Robust data cleaning and preprocessing scripts are included to handle missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues, ensuring a solid foundation for analysis.

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Dive deep into the dataset with EDA tools to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations. Visualizations such as line charts, bar graphs, and heatmaps provide a comprehensive understanding of the data.

4.Geospatial Analysis:
Leverage geospatial visualizations to map the spread of COVID-19 across regions. Interactive maps and choropleth plots offer a dynamic view of the global or regional impact.

5.Time Series Analysis:
Analyze the temporal aspect of the pandemic using time series techniques. Explore daily, weekly, or monthly trends to understand how the situation has evolved over time.

6.Statistical Insights:
Extract statistical measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation to quantify the central tendency and variability of key metrics. This provides a quantitative understanding of the dataset.
